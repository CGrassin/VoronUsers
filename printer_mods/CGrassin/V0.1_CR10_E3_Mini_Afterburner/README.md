# V0.1 Ender 3/CR10 all metal hotend for the Mini Afterburner

## Description

This mod for the Voron V0.1 makes it compatible with inexpensive "all metal" hotends that are originally designed for the CR10/Ender 3 (or clones). The performance (maximum flow) may not be not as good as the hotends that were planned by the Voron team, but this part is otherwise identical/compatible with the original Mini Afterburner.

It should be compatible with any CR10/Ender 3 hotend but you should buy an "all metal" version that does not require a PTFE tube to be inserted.

## Print settings

As stated in the Voron documentation:
* ABS
* 0.2mm layer hight
* 0.4mm extrusion width
* 40% infill
* wall count 4
* top/bottom layers 5

However, support material is required to support the insert lip. You should use a custom support plugin or tweek the "Minimum support area" setting to avoid getting support material everywhere.

## Bom

The parts required are:
* An all metal CR10 hotend like the one shown in pictures (eg: keyword for Aliexpress "ender 3 hotend all metal")
* 2 M3 Brass heatstake inserts - short M3x5x4
* 2 M3Ã—16mm screw (any head type)
* All the parts (3D printed and hardware) required to build a normal Mini Afterburner, except the "[a]\_Cowling". Please note that concerning the "[a]\_Mid\_Body" part, you should print the **Dragon** version and add about 10mm of PTFE tube, as instructed in the manual.

## Build instructions

The build instructions are basically the Voron manual. The only difference is that you need to add two heatstake inserts to be able to secure the hotend.
